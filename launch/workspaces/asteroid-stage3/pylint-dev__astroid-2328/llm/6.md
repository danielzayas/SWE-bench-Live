##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on python:3.8.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Python-Specific Instructions:
- Make sure the package is installed from source in editable mode before running tests (e.g., `pip install -e .`)
- Avoid using tox to run tests if possible as it's designed for CI. Read tox.ini to understand setup
- Check requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml for dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
    <command>bash command</command>
    e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
    e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
    <search>the search query</search>
    e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
    e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
    e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
    <stop></stop>


Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: The requirements_dev.txt only references requirements_minimal.txt, which likely contains the core dependencies. I should check the requirements_minimal.txt to see what dependencies are needed, then install them along with the development tools listed. After installing dependencies, I will install the project in editable mode and then run the tests.
Action: <command>cat requirements_minimal.txt</command>

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: The minimal requirements include some testing tools like pytest and coverage, along with tbump and contributors-txt. I will install these dependencies, then proceed to install the project in editable mode. After that, I will run the tests using pytest to verify the setup.

WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager, possibly rendering your system unusable. It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv. Use the --root-user-action option if you know what you are doing and want to suppress this warning.
