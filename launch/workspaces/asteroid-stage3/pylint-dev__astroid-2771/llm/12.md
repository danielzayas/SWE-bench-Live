What's this?
------------

The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
python source code. It is currently the library powering pylint's capabilities.

It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast`
module.  It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by
recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new
node classes have additional methods and attributes for different
usages. They include some support for static inference and local name
scopes. Furthermore, astroid can also build partial trees by inspecting living
objects.


Installation
------------

Extract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run::

    pip install .


If you want to do an editable installation, you can run::

    pip install -e .


If you have any questions, please mail the code-quality@python.org
mailing list for support. See
http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality for subscription
information and archives.

Python Versions
---------------

astroid 2.0 is currently available for Python 3 only. If you want Python 2
support, use an older version of astroid (though note that these versions
are no longer supported).

Test
----

Tests are in the 'test' subdirectory. To launch the whole tests suite, you can use
either `tox` or `pytest`::

    tox
    pytest

```
File: tox.ini
```
[tox]
envlist = py{39,310,311,312,313}
skip_missing_interpreters = true
isolated_build = true

[testenv]
deps =
  -r requirements_full.txt
commands =
  pytest --cov {posargs}

[testenv:formatting]
deps =
    -r requirements_dev.txt
commands =
    pre-commit run --all-files

[testenv:docs]
skipsdist = True
usedevelop = True
changedir = doc/
deps =
    -r doc/requirements.txt
commands =
    sphinx-build -E -b html . build

Please recommend a suitable base Docker image. Consider:
1. The programming language and version requirements
2. Common system dependencies
3. Use official images when possible

Select a base image from the following candidate list:
['python:3.6', 'python:3.7', 'python:3.8', 'python:3.9', 'python:3.10', 'python:3.11']
Wrap the image name in a block like <image>ubuntu:20.04</image> to indicate your choice.

##### LLM OUTPUT #####
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the provided files and their content, the project is using Python 3.9 or newer (e.g., Python 3.10 or 3.11), as indicated by the tox environment and the requirements. The dependencies include modern tools like black, pre-commit, pylint>=3.2.7, and ruff, which are compatible with recent Python versions.

**Recommended base image:**

- Use an official Python image that matches the Python version requirements.
- Python 3.9 is explicitly supported and widely used.
- Python 3.10 and 3.11 are also suitable if you prefer the latest features and improvements.

**Considering stability and compatibility, I recommend:**

<image>python:3.10</image>

This provides a recent, stable Python environment with good support for the tools and dependencies listed, and is an official image optimized for Docker use.

---

**Final choice:**

<image>python:3.10</image>
