Please recommend a suitable base Docker image. Consider:
1. The programming language and version requirements
2. Common system dependencies
3. Use official images when possible

Select a base image from the following candidate list:
['python:3.6', 'python:3.7', 'python:3.8', 'python:3.9', 'python:3.10', 'python:3.11']
Wrap the image name in a block like <image>ubuntu:20.04</image> to indicate your choice.

Based on the provided candidate list and considering best practices, I recommend selecting an official Python image that aligns with your application's requirements. Since the specific programming language version isn't explicitly stated, choosing a recent stable version is advisable for better support and security.

Assuming you want a modern, well-supported Python version, I suggest:

<python:3.11></python:3.11>

This image provides the latest features and improvements, along with the benefits of official maintenance. It also includes common system dependencies suitable for most Python applications.

If you have a specific Python version requirement, please specify, and I can adjust the recommendation accordingly.
