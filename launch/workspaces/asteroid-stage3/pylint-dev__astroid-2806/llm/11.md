What's this?
------------

The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
python source code. It is currently the library powering pylint's capabilities.

It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast`
module.  It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by
recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new
node classes have additional methods and attributes for different
usages. They include some support for static inference and local name
scopes. Furthermore, astroid can also build partial trees by inspecting living
objects.


Installation
------------

Extract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run::

    pip install .


If you want to do an editable installation, you can run::

    pip install -e .


If you have any questions, please mail the code-quality@python.org
mailing list for support. See
http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/code-quality for subscription
information and archives.

Python Versions
---------------

astroid 2.0 is currently available for Python 3 only. If you want Python 2
support, use an older version of astroid (though note that these versions
are no longer supported).

Test
----

Tests are in the 'test' subdirectory. To launch the whole tests suite, you can use
either `tox` or `pytest`::

    tox
    pytest

```

Please recommend a suitable base Docker image. Consider:
1. The programming language and version requirements
2. Common system dependencies
3. Use official images when possible

Select a base image from the following candidate list:
['python:3.6', 'python:3.7', 'python:3.8', 'python:3.9', 'python:3.10', 'python:3.11']
Wrap the image name in a block like <image>ubuntu:20.04</image> to indicate your choice.

##### LLM OUTPUT #####
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the provided files, the project uses Python 3.12 features (e.g., `setuptools; python_version>="3.12"`), which is not available in the listed candidate images. The latest candidate image is `python:3.11`, which supports Python 3.11 but not 3.12.

Given this, the most suitable base image from your list is:

<python:3.11>python:3.11</python:3.11>

This image provides a recent Python 3.11 environment, aligning closely with the project's requirements and supporting most modern Python features. If you need to support Python 3.12 specifically, you would need to consider a custom build or a different base image outside the provided options.
