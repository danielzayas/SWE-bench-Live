##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ Human Message =================================

Given a file of the repository, determine if it is relevant for setting up a development environment for the repository or providing information about how to set up dev env (how to setup, install, test, etc.). This determines whether the file's content is fed to the LLM and helps it set up the environment.

Welcome to astroid's documentation!
===================================

**astroid** is a library for AST parsing, static analysis and inference,
currently powering most of **pylint** capabilities.

It offers support for parsing Python source code into ASTs, similar to how
the builtin **ast** module works. On top of that, it can partially infer various
Python constructs, as seen in the following example::

   from astroid import parse
   module = parse('''
   def func(first, second):
       return first + second

   arg_1 = 2
   arg_2 = 3
   func(arg_1, arg_2)
   ''')
   >>> module.body[-1]
   <Expr l.3 at 0x10ab46f28>
   >>> inferred = next(module.body[-1].value.infer())
   >>> inferred
   <Const.int l.None at 0x10ab00588>
   >>> inferred.value
   5


**astroid** also allows the user to write various inference transforms for
enhancing its Python understanding, helping as well **pylint** in the process
of figuring out the dynamic nature of Python.
