Please recommend a suitable base Docker image. Consider:
1. The programming language and version requirements
2. Common system dependencies
3. Use official images when possible

Select a base image from the following candidate list:
['python:3.6', 'python:3.7', 'python:3.8', 'python:3.9', 'python:3.10', 'python:3.11']
Wrap the image name in a block like <image>ubuntu:20.04</image> to indicate your choice.

Given the provided candidate images and considering best practices, I recommend selecting the latest stable Python version that aligns with your application's requirements. 

If your application supports Python 3.11, it is advisable to choose the most recent version to benefit from the latest features and security updates. Additionally, using an official Python image ensures compatibility and ease of maintenance.

Based on these considerations, the suitable base Docker image is:

<image>python:3.11</image>
