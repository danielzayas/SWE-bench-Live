##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to install dependencies and set up a environment that is able to run the tests of the project.

- You start with an initial Docker container based on python:3.11.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- No need to clone the project again.

The final objective is to successfully run the tests of the project.


### Python-Specific Instructions:
- Make sure the package is installed from source in editable mode before running tests (e.g., `pip install -e .`)
- Avoid using tox to run tests if possible as it's designed for CI. Read tox.ini to understand setup
- Check requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml for dependencies


================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
    <command>bash command</command>
    e.g. install build-essential: <command>apt-get install -y build-essential</command>
    e.g. view file content: <command>cat README.md</command>
Search: search the web for if you need some information, generate query and reply with following format:
    <search>the search query</search>
    e.g. <search>how to fix 'No module named setuptools'</search>
    e.g. <search>how to install python3 on ubuntu</search>
    e.g. <search>how to create development environment for python3</search>
Stop: stop the setup loop once you think the setup is complete, reply with following format:
    <stop></stop>


Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: I need to install the project dependencies, including those specified in requirements files and setup configuration, then install the project in editable mode to run tests properly. I'll start by examining the `pyproject.toml` and `tox.ini` to understand the dependencies and testing setup. Since I already have the project files, I will check the `pyproject.toml` for build system requirements and dependencies, and the `tox.ini` for test commands. First, I will search for the `pyproject.toml` content to identify dependencies and build system info.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: The `pyproject.toml` indicates that the project uses setuptools as the build backend and has minimal dependencies, specifically `typing-extensions` for Python versions below 3.11. The `tox.ini` is present, and the pytest configuration is set up to run tests in the `tests` directory with specific options. To set up the environment, I need to install the dependencies listed in `requirements_dev.txt`, `requirements_full.txt`, and possibly the minimal requirements, then install the project in editable mode. After that, I will run pytest to verify the tests.

First, I will check the contents of `requirements_dev.txt` to see what dependencies are needed for development and testing.

Action: <command>cat requirements_dev.txt</command>
================================ Human Message =================================

Observation:
cat requirements_dev.txt
-r requirements_minimal.txt

# Tools used during development, prefer running these with pre-commit

exit code: 0

##### LLM OUTPUT #####
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Thought: The `requirements_dev.txt` only references `requirements_minimal.txt`, which suggests that the development environment depends on the minimal requirements plus tools like black, pre-commit, pylint, and ruff. To set up the environment, I will install the minimal requirements first, then the dev tools. After that, I will install the project in editable mode and run the tests with pytest.

I will proceed with installing the minimal requirements from `requirements_minimal.txt`, then install the dev requirements, and finally install the project in editable mode.

Action: <command>pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt</command>
