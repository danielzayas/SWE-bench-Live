By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n-the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n-rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-distribute and/or modify the software.\n-\n-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-authors' reputations.\n-\n-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.\n-\n-\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n-under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n-refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n-the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n-along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-\n-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n-\n-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n-    parties under the terms of this License.\n-\n-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n-\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n-collective works based on the Program.\n-\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n-the scope of this License.\n-\n-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n-\n-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n-    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n-\n-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n-    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n-    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n-\n-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n-special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n-itself accompanies the executable.\n-\n-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-\n-  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n-parties remain in full compliance.\n-\n-  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Program or works based on it.\n-\n-  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n-this License.\n-\n-  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n-\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n-circumstances.\n-\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-\n-  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n-\n-  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n-address new problems or concerns.\n-\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n-later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n-Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n-this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n-Foundation.\n-\n-  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n-to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n-Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n-make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n-of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n-of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n-\n-\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n-\n-  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n-FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n-OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n-PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\n-OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n-MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\n-TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n-REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-\n-  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\n-INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\n-OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\n-TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\n-YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\n-PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n-\n-\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n-\n-  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n-\n-  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n-the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-\n-    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n-\n-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n-    (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n-    GNU General Public License for more details.\n-\n-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n-    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n-    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n-\n-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n-\n-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n-when it starts in an interactive mode:\n-\n-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n-    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n-    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n-    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n-\n-The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\n-be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\n-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n-\n-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n-school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n-\n-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n-  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n-\n-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n-  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n-\n-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n-Public License instead of this License.\ndiff --git a/COPYING.LESSER b/LICENSE\nsimilarity index 100%\nrename from COPYING.LESSER\nrename to LICENSE\ndiff --git a/MANIFEST.in b/MANIFEST.in\nindex 8cf73ba029..1d4d411b77 100644\n--- a/MANIFEST.in\n+++ b/MANIFEST.in\n@@ -1,7 +1,6 @@\n include ChangeLog\n include README.rst\n-include COPYING\n-include COPYING.LESSER\n+include LICENSE\n include pytest.ini\n recursive-include tests *.py *.zip *.egg *.pth\n recursive-include astroid/brain *.py\ndiff --git a/astroid/__init__.py b/astroid/__init__.py\nindex eec74dd9c9..bc9c522937 100644\n--- a/astroid/__init__.py\n+++ b/astroid/__init__.py\n@@ -11,7 +11,7 @@\n #
