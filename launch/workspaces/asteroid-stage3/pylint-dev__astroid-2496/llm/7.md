##### LLM INPUT #####
================================ System Message ================================

You are a developer. Your task is to verify whether the environment for the given project is set up correctly. Your colleague has set up a Docker environment for the project. You need to verify if it can successfully run the tests of the project.
- You interact with a Bash session inside this container.
- The container is based on python:3.11.
- The setup commands that your colleague has run are ['pip install -r requirements_dev.txt', 'pip install -e .', 'pytest']
- Project files are located in /testbed within the container, and your current working directory of bash is already set to /testbed.
- Use the same test framework as your colleague, because that aligns with the setup stage.
- Only test commands, skip linting/packaging/publishing commands.
- Do not change the state of the environment, your task is to verify not to fix it. If you see issues, report it not fix it.
- You can tolerate a few test cases failures—as long as most tests pass, it's good enough. ## Important Note:

Your test command must output detailed pass/fail status for each test item. This is mandatory. For example, with pytest, use the -rA option to get output like:
```
...
PASSED tests/test_resources.py::test_fetch_centromeres
PASSED tests/test_vis.py::test_to_ucsc_colorstring
```
Since we need to parse the test output to extract a test item → status mapping, **this requirement is mandatory**. If you observed that your test command does not produce such detailed output, you must adjust it accordingly.

In summary, your goal is:
1. Write the test commands that could output detailed pass/fail status for each test item, you can iterate until it does. (this is mandatory, DO NOT ignore this requirement!!! This is your obligation to correctly identify the test commands to run the test suite of the project, and find a way to output detailed pass/fail status)
2. Run the test command to verify if the environment is set up correctly. If not, report any observed issues. If you think the setup is correct, report none issue.

================================ Human Message =================================


You run in a loop of Thought, Action, Observation.
At the end of the loop you should use Action to stop the loop.

Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.
> Important Note: Each step, reply with only **one** (Thought, Action) pair.
> Important Note: Do not reply **Observation**, it will be provided by the system.

Your available actions are:

Command: run a command in the bash, reply with following format, your command should not require sudo or interactive input:
    <command>...</command>
    e.g. run pytest with detailed output turned on: <command>pytest -rA</command>
    e.g. <command>tox -- -rA</command>
Issue: stop the verify loop once you think the setup is complete, and reply with the issue of the setup:
    <issue>...</issue>
    e.g. <issue>some dependency is missing, run `pytest` failed</issue>
    e.g. <issue>None</issue> if you think the setup is correct (remember to tolerate a few test cases failures as long as most tests pass)


Observation will be the result of running those actions.


Project Structure: the structure of the project, including files and directories.
Related Files: the content of related files of the project that may help you understand the project.
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: <command>your bash command here</command> or <search>your search query</search> or other actions available
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times) ...
Thought: I think the setup should be fine
Action: <stop>stop the setup</stop>
Answer: the final result

Thought: The project uses pytest as the test framework, and the setup commands include installing dependencies and running pytest. To verify the environment, I should run pytest with the -rA option to get detailed pass/fail status for each test item, as required. I will run pytest with the -rA flag to ensure detailed output and check if most tests pass, tolerating a few failures.  
Action: <command>pytest -rA</command>
