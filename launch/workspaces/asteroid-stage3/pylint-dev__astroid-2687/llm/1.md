Please recommend a suitable base Docker image. Consider:
1. The programming language and version requirements
2. Common system dependencies
3. Use official images when possible

Select a base image from the following candidate list:
['python:3.6', 'python:3.7', 'python:3.8', 'python:3.9', 'python:3.10', 'python:3.11']
Wrap the image name in a block like <image>ubuntu:20.04</image> to indicate your choice.

Based on the provided candidate list and considering best practices, I recommend selecting the latest stable Python version that aligns with your application's requirements. Since the latest in the list is Python 3.11, and assuming no specific version constraints, Python 3.11 is a suitable choice for future-proofing and access to recent features.

Additionally, using an official Python image ensures compatibility and ease of maintenance. These images are based on Debian or Alpine Linux, which include common system dependencies and are well-maintained.

**Recommended base image:**

<image>python:3.11</image>
