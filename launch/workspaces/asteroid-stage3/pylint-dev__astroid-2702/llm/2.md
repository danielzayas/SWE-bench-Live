Please recommend a suitable base Docker image. Consider:
1. The programming language and version requirements
2. Common system dependencies
3. Use official images when possible

Select a base image from the following candidate list:
['python:3.6', 'python:3.7', 'python:3.8', 'python:3.9', 'python:3.10', 'python:3.11']
Wrap the image name in a block like <image>ubuntu:20.04</image> to indicate your choice.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the provided candidate list and considering best practices, I recommend selecting a Python version that aligns with your application's requirements. Since no specific version details are provided, choosing a recent stable version is advisable for better support and security.

Assuming you want a balance of stability and features, I suggest:

<python:3.10>

This version is widely used, well-supported, and compatible with most libraries and dependencies. It also benefits from ongoing security updates and improvements.

If your application requires a different Python version, you can adjust accordingly from the list.
