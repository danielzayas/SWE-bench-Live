2025-12-04 21:08:59,032 - Base image response missing <image> tag, retrying. Raw response: Based on the provided candidate list and considering best practices, I recommend selecting an official Python image that aligns with your project's Python version requirements and provides a solid foundation for common dependencies.

If your project requires Python 3.8, for example, the most suitable base image would be:

<python:3.8></python:3.8>

If you need a different version, simply replace 3.8 with the appropriate version from the list.

Please specify your exact Python version requirement
