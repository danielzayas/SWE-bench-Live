Please recommend a suitable base Docker image. Consider:
1. The programming language and version requirements
2. Common system dependencies
3. Use official images when possible

Select a base image from the following candidate list:
['python:3.6', 'python:3.7', 'python:3.8', 'python:3.9', 'python:3.10', 'python:3.11']
Wrap the image name in a block like <image>ubuntu:20.04</image> to indicate your choice.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the provided candidate list and considering best practices, I recommend selecting a Python version that aligns with your application's requirements. Since no specific version details are provided, I suggest choosing a recent stable version to ensure compatibility with common dependencies and security updates.

If your application does not specify a particular Python version, I recommend:

<python:3.11>

This version offers the latest features and improvements, ensuring better performance and security. It also aligns with current best practices for new projects.

If you need a slightly older, more widely supported version, Python 3.10 is also a solid choice:

<python:3.10>

Please select the one that best fits your application's compatibility needs.
