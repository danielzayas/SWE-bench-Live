Please recommend a suitable base Docker image. Consider:
1. The programming language and version requirements
2. Common system dependencies
3. Use official images when possible

Select a base image from the following candidate list:
['python:3.6', 'python:3.7', 'python:3.8', 'python:3.9', 'python:3.10', 'python:3.11']
Wrap the image name in a block like <image>ubuntu:20.04</image> to indicate your choice.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the provided candidate list and considering best practices, I recommend selecting an official Python image that aligns with your application's Python version requirements and system dependencies.

Since no specific details about the Python version or dependencies are provided in the related file section, I suggest choosing the latest stable Python version from the list to ensure compatibility and security.

Therefore, the most suitable base Docker image is:

<image>python:3.11</image>
